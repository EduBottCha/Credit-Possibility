This mini-project is centered around the learning of the concepts of:
- Logistic Regression
- Data Scaling and prevention of variables overiding their mathematical importance because of scale
- Data Modification with techniques such as OneHotEncoder and OrdinalEncoder
- Measurments to better ensure the precision of said type of model
